# INFO320 - Team Weka - Flamingo Swappable Batteries
This repository is to store the work towards a prototype implementation for our INFO320 project at Victoria University of Wellington during Trimester 2, 2020. 

The project team consists of 4 students who are working with Flamingo, a Wellington based e-scooter rideshare company. 

## The Team
- Matthew Tansley (Developer) - GitHub: [CrunchyPancakes](https://github.com/CrunchyPancakes)
- Jayden Jiang (Developer) - GitHub: [jiangjayden](https://github.com/jiangjayden)
- Jacob Kavinta (Designer)
- Leban Tadesse (Designer)


## Background taken from project plan
"Flamingo is an e-scooter rideshare company based in Wellington which aims to provide an alternative to cars and give people a ‘fast and fun’ way to get around. Flamingo wishes to transition to a swappable battery model for their e-scooters, as opposed to the current model where scooters are collected in vans for recharging. The new model is expected to be more environmentally friendly, as replacement batteries will be transported on e-bikes, and provide convenience to staff, as swapping batteries is easier than transporting scooters.

Team Weka’s goal is to develop a prototype mobile application to support the task of locating scooters and replacing their battery. The project will assist in the realization of a swappable battery model for Flamingo, as they can gain experience and conduct testing with a prototype app, and use Team Weka’s efforts to accelerate the deployment of the new model."
